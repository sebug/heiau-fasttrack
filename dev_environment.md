# Dev Environment
While initially I was running from the Oracle Training VM, this was not really
a good setup. Switching to installing it on [lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima)

	limactl start oracletraining
	limactl shell oracletraining

Then following the instructions here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1121649/how-to-install-oracle-18c-enterprise-edition-on-ubuntu-18-04
